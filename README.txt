# Repository

## Description

This project focuses on predicting personality traits using statistical models and deep learning algorithms. The goal is to provide a tool capable of estimating personality traits based on social media text as input.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains two main folders with estimations based on different numbers of personality traits:

- `estimations_5_traits`: Contains models and data related to the estimation of the Big Five personality traits (Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience).

- `estimations_3_traits`: Includes models and data for a simplified version of personality prediction, focusing on three main traits (Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Openness to Experience).
