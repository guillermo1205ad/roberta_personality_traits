Personality Trait Estimation

This repository, named `estimations_3_traits`, contains essential resources for a Master's thesis project in Business Sciences with a Specialization in Entrepreneurship at Universidad Cat√≥lica del Norte. The project focuses on estimating three personality traits: "Extraversion," "Neuroticism," and "Openness to Experience," based on Goldberg's Big Five theory (1992). Advanced Natural Language Processing techniques have been employed to achieve this goal.

Repository Contents:

- data: This subfolder contains the estimates generated by the trained model (RoBERTa Fine-Tuned with Pennebaker and King Essays, 1999). Files ending in `_1` or `_2` correspond to the first or second quasi-experiment, respectively. It also includes the tweets and personality profiles generated by the model as the final output.

- python: This folder includes the datasets used to train the model, saved as `final_model_2_a.pt`. It also contains the final output of the model (estimates) and Python scripts required to train the neural network model and use the trained model to predict personality traits from social media text.

- R: This subfolder contains R scripts used to compute T-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests for the first and second quasi-experiments.

- stata: This folder includes Stata scripts used to estimate stochastic dominance within the thesis project framework. These scripts facilitate the analysis and comparison of personality trait distributions across different groups (Schumpeterian and Non-Schumpeterian), providing detailed insights into personality trait differences.
